# run headed test with delay of 1 sec with:

# if using page objects, then all interactions should be performed using page
# objects
# It is not recommended to mix raw Playwright calls (except expect assertions)
# with page object calls. That becomes confusing, and it encourages poor
# practices like dirty hacks and copypasta. It also causes a test automation
# project to lose strength from a lack of conformity in design.

# testing different browsers: use command line option --browser + chromium,
# firefox or webkit
# run tests against multiple browsers at the same time and list each test
# result with its browser:
# python -m pytest tests --browser chromium --browser firefox
# --browser webkit --verbose
# test against stock browsers on your machine trough browser channels:
# python -m pytest tests --browser-channel chrome
# python -m pytest tests --browser-channel msedge

# to test responsive layouts:
# python -m pytest tests --device "<device name>"
# full list of available devices:

# capture a screenshot at the end of every test (old ones will be deleted):
# python -m pytest tests --screenshot on
# to save a screenshot for every failing test only:
# python -m pytest tests --screenshot only-on-failure
# to save a video for every failing test:
# python -m pytest tests --video retain-on-failure

# to run tests in parallel (with pytest-xdist installed) add the -n option
# python -m pytest tests -n 2
# Typically, the optimal degree of concurrency is the number of processors or
# cores on your machine. Try running these tests in parallel at different
# degrees of concurrency (2, 3, 4, 5, higher?) to find the fastest completion
# time.

# Warning: DuckDuckGo may throttle your tests' requests if they happen too
# quickly. To work around this problem, try running with
# --headed or with --slowmo 100.)

# You can also test multiple browsers in parallel. For example, the
# following command will run the parameterized tests against all three
# Playwright browsers at 5x parallel:

# $ python3 -m pytest tests -n 5 --browser chromium --browser firefox
# --browser webkit
